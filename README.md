## About The Project

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/benisalla/Tiny-ViT-Transformer-from-scratch/assets/89405673/4935a979-a8e8-40f0-8ffb-e621025aac2f" width="600" height="300"/>

TINY-ViT offers a minimalist, yet complete implementation of the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture for computer vision tasks. This project aims to provide a clear and structured approach to building Vision Transformers, making it accessible for educational purposes and practical applications alike.

## Features

- **Modular Design**: Clear separation of components like data processing, model architecture, and training routines.
- **Customizable**: Easy to adapt the architecture and data pipeline for various datasets and applications.
- **Poetry Dependency Management**: Utilizes Poetry for simple and reliable package management.
- **Advanced Embedding Techniques**: Implements three distinct techniques for image embedding in Vision Transformers:
  - **ViTConv2dEmbedding**: Utilizes a Conv2D layer to transform input images into a sequence of flattened 2D patches, with a learnable class token appended.
  ```python
  class ViTConv2dEmbedding(nn.Module):
  ```
  - **ViTLNEmbedding**: Applies layer normalization to flattened input patches before projecting them into an embedding space, enhancing stability and performance.
  ```python
  class ViTLNEmbedding(nn.Module):
  ``` 
  - **ViTPyCon2DEmbedding**: Offers a unique tensor reshaping strategy to transform input images into a sequence of embedded patches, also including a learnable class token.
  ```python
  class ViTPyCon2DEmbedding(nn.Module):
  ```
    
- **Custom Activation Function**: Incorporates the **ViTGELUActFun** class, which implements the Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU), providing smoother gating behavior than traditional nonlinearities like ReLU.
  ```python
  class ViTGELUActFun(nn.Module):
  ```

## Model Performance

The tiny-vit model was evaluated on a comprehensive set of test images to gauge its accuracy and performance. Here are the results:

- **Accuracy on test images**: 81.60%

These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the tiny-vit model in handling complex image recognition tasks. We continuously seek to improve the model and update the metrics as new test results become available.
