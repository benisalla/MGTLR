## Introduction

The Music Generator with ABC Annotations is a project designed to create music using the ABC notation format. It leverages the power of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), and transformers to generate musical compositions.

## Features

- Generate music in the ABC notation format.
- Utilize RNN, LSTM, and transformers for music composition.
- Customizable parameters for music generation.

## Installation

To get started with the Music Generator, follow these installation steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   $ cd your-repo
   ```

3. Install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To generate music using the Music Generator, you can use the following code snippet as an example:

```python
# Example code for music generation
import music_generator

music = music_generator.generate_music()
print(music)
```

You can customize the parameters and settings according to your preferences.
